WARINING - PLEASE ASK ADMIN AT YOUR SCHOOL IF YOU COULD HOST THIS ON THIER WIFI

Functionality - ChatterBox needs to be ran on a non-chrombook device, the following devices it can run on are Macs, Windows, prob Linux, and Samsungs via termux.

Tested Devices - Windows/Samsung but im betting it works on all other platforms

Instalation - 

STEP 1: your going to want git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and python (https://www.python.org) installed on your device

STEP 2: You will open up Command Line and Clone https://github.com/soultoast3481/ChatterBox.git then cd into your repository

Step 3: type in python app.py and the app will start up

WARNING THIS APP SUCKS ASS BUT IT WORKS. IT WAS MADE BY A 16 YEAR OLD SO EXPECT THAT MUCH. 
 also if you cant figure out how to start this thing up your under 12 and should give up pronto, these steps couldent be more clear unless you know absolutly nothing about computers.
